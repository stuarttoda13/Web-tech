        <p> I chose <a href="https://www.babson.com"> Babson College</a> because I wanted a focus on my major right away by taking courses like intro to accounting while also being a part of a small community.<br> I want to pursue trading in the future or some IT related field because as of yet I am not sure what I want to be in the future. I was hoping this class would be a stepping stone to something greater that what I presume.</p>

        <p>My favorite sport is soccer or futbol depending on what part of the world you are from. I love the game and what it represents. Although soccer just seems to be another game or sport, I see it as an art both on an individual skill level of a player but also the high level of uniformity of a team. Each game captivates me as I look for both of these attributes during a game.
